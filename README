Hi!  The old README, as with the other docs, is in doc/.  GitHub hates this,
though.

But what I'm here to talk about is that Jennifer Hickey has agreed to take over
the maintenance of LiveConsole.  Her fork, now the canonical repo, is here:
https://github.com/jencompgeek/live-console

She'll be doing the future releases to RubyGems.org and that is pretty awesome
of her.  Thanks, Jen!

Also a special thanks to Roger D. Pack, who has helped out with some bug fixes.
He's here:  https://github.com/rdp/

I'm grateful LiveConsole has been shown this much love!  Thanks, everyone!
